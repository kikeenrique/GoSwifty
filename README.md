`GoSwifty` is especially useful to track the progress of your migration from Objective-C to Swift. So far you can measure your project towards four metrics:
- Swift files count vs Objective-C files count.
- Swift lines of code vs Objective-C lines of code.
- Swift classes count vs Objective-C classes count.
- Swift structs count vs Objective-C structs count.
